iversity students come from different parts of the country with various purpose. However£¬a closer look at their reason for studying at the university will enable us to classify them roughly into three groups: those who have a passion for learning, those who wish to attain a bright future, and those who learn with no definite purpose.
Firstly, there are many student who learn simply because they pursue their goal of learning. Some read a wealth of British and American novels because they are keenly interested in literature. Others sit in front of the computer screen,working on a new program virtually day and night, because they find some computer programs fascinating ,and they dream of becoming a ¡°Bill Gates¡± one day.
Secondly there are students who work hard mainly for a better and more prosperous future. It seems that the majority of students fall into this group. After admission to the university, they read books after books to acquire knowledge from all of the resources which are available to them, and finally, to succeed in the future job market.
Thirdly, there are still students who learn without a clear goal. They take courses, finish homework, enjoy life on campus, but don¡¯t want to sample anything new or challenging. They have no idea what they will be doing after college. And they may end up with nothing in their lives.
