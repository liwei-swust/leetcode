7 We have confidence that your journey toward self-discovery and your progress toward finding your own passion will yield more than personal advancement.  We believe that as you become members of our community of scholars, you will soon come to recognize that with the abundant opportunities for self-enrichment provided by the university, there also come responsibilities.  A wise man said: "Education is simply the soul of a society as it passes from one generation to another."  You are the inheritors of the hard work of your families and the hard work of many countless others who came before you.  They built and transmitted the knowledge you will need to succeed.  Now it is your turn.  What knowledge will you acquire?  What passions will you discover?  What will you do to build a strong and prosperous future for the generations that will come after you? 
我们相信，你们的自我发现之旅和对爱好的寻求带给你们的将不仅仅是个人的进步。我们相信，当你们成为我们的学者群体中的一员时，你们很快就会认识到，大学不仅提供大量自我充实的机会，同时也带来了责任。一位智者说过：“教育代代相传，它就是社会的灵魂。”你们是你们家庭辛勤劳动成果的传承者，也是无数前辈辛勤劳动成果的传承者。他们积累
了知识，并把知识传递给你们，而这些知识正是你们取得成功所必需的。现在轮到你们了。
你们会获取什么样的知识？你们会发现什么样的兴趣爱好？你们怎样做才能为你们的
子孙后代创造一个强大昌盛的未来？
8 We take great pleasure in opening the door to this great step in your journey. We take delight in the many opportunities which you will find, and in the responsibilities that you will carry as citizens of your communities, your country, and the world. Welcome！
我们很高兴能为你们人生旅途中这一重大阶段开启大门。我们很高兴你们将获得许多机
会，也很高兴你们将作为社区、国家乃至世界的公民承担起应有的责任。
欢迎你们！

University students come from different parts of the country with various purpose. However，a closer look at their reason for studying at the university will enable us to classify them roughly into three groups: those who have a passion for learning, those who wish to attain a bright future, and those who learn with no definite purpose.
Firstly, there are many student who learn simply because they pursue their goal of learning. Some read a wealth of British and American novels because they are keenly interested in literature. Others sit in front of the computer screen,working on a new program virtually day and night, because they find some computer programs fascinating ,and they dream of becoming a “Bill Gates” one day.
Secondly there are students who work hard mainly for a better and more prosperous future. It seems that the majority of students fall into this group. After admission to the university, they read books after books to acquire knowledge from all of the resources which are available to them, and finally, to succeed in the future job market.
Thirdly, there are still students who learn without a clear goal. They take courses, finish homework, enjoy life on campus, but don’t want to sample anything new or challenging. They have no idea what they will be doing after college. And they may end up with nothing in their lives.



6 For most undergraduates, non-stop Internet connectivity is the fuel of college life. ?More than just toys, these instruments are powerful tools for the storage and management of virtually every kind of information. And as more people around the world adopt these instruments, they are becoming indispensable. So, students should use the wonders of the Internet to do homework, review lecture outlines, take part in class discussions and network online with their friends. ?But in doing so, students must remember to regulate and balance their time. ?Too much time online can mean too little time in real-life studying or exercising or visiting with friends. ?Students should not let the Internet world on their computer screens take them away from the real world outside.?
对于大多数本科生来说，永不间断的互联网是大学生活的动力。 网络工具不只是玩具，而且是储存和管理几乎各种信息的强大工具。 随着世界上越来越多的人使用这些工具，它们已经变得不可或缺。 所以，学生应该运用互联网所创造的奇迹来完成作业、复习讲座提纲、参与课堂讨论、与朋友们进行网上社交。 但是在做这些的同时，学生们必须记住，要控制和平衡好时间。 上网时间过长就意味着在现实生活中学习、锻炼或和朋友叙谈的时间过少。学生们不应该让电脑屏幕上的互联网世界使他们脱离外面的现实世界。
12 Colleges around the world have been replacing their computer systems for the past decade, in large part to provide students with the most advanced free system. ?The anywhere-anytime access has already yielded amazing benefits in education. ?With the widespread application of computer technologies, we are going to produce a generation of problem-solvers and intelligent thinkers, which is indispensable for the future of the world.?
在过去 10 年里，世界各地的大学都在更换其计算机系统，主要是为了给学生提供最先进的免费系统。随时随地的网络连接使教育深受裨益。随着计算机技术的广泛应用，我们将培养出善于解决问题和善于思考的一代人，这对于世界的未来是至关重要的。


1 Who's a hero these days?  In an era of heightened heroism, the word hero has become more common.  We use hero to describe both victims and survivors of all kinds of difficulties and tragedies.  Who are the heroes among us? 
2 谁是当今的英雄？ 在一个英雄主义发扬光大的时代，“英雄”一词已经变得更加常见。 我们把各种困难和悲剧的受害者和并存者都称为“英雄”。 那么，我们身边哪些人是英雄呢？
13 The inspiring stories of heroes help remind us that ordinary people can do extraordinary things, whether it is in the fulfillment of their duties or as part of everyday life. We honor the fireman, the policeman, and the average citizen by recognizing their heroism. Perhaps, even more importantly, we honor them by working to change the circumstances that led to their death.  By honoring them we can be inspired by them.  Will we be heroes when circumstances call on us to act heroically? Hopefully, we will! 
14 英雄们激励人心的事迹有助于提醒我们，平凡的人也可以做出不平凡的事，不管是履行职责，还是在日常生活中。 我们向消防员、警察和普通平民致敬，赞扬其大无畏的精神。 也许，甚至更为重要的是，我们要通过改变让他们遭遇不并的环境来向他们致敬。 通过缅怀他们，我们可以从中得到鼓舞。 一旦有情况召唤我们挺身而出时，我们会当英雄吗？ 但愿我们会！

1 "Is anybody truly honest?"??As numerous accounts of cheating, lying, and?fraud?crowd our newspaper pages and TV news, it seems that honesty is a rapidly vanishing value.??And the reports indicate that, around the globe,corruption?and dishonesty are so widespread that the health and well-being of society are at risk.??These reports include stories such as the students who faced criminal charges for selling in advance copies of a university final exam, a student who was expelled?when he turned in a term paper with the purchase?receipt for it still inside the pages, and a clerk who ran his own Christmas cards through the office postage meter and was found out when he sent one of the cards to the company treasurer!?We have all read or heard accounts such as these, not to mention the stories of dishonesty amongst all layers?of society as exemplified?by?consumers who steal and politicians who demand?bribes.?Travelers?ripped?off so many towels last year that it cost a major hotel chain $3 million to replace them.?Especially troubling are the reports that dishonesty is increasing amongst student populations around the world.?
有真正诚实的人吗？”我们的报纸版面和电视新闻充斥着不计其数的有关欺骗、说谎和诈骗的报道，诚实似乎已经成为正在迅速消失的价值观。而且这些报道表明，全球范围内腐败和不诚实现象蔓延范围之广已经危及到了社会的安康这些报道中包括诸如此类的故事：学生因考试前贩卖大学期末考题而面临犯罪指控；名学生因提交买来的、还夹着收据的学期论文而被勒令退学；一名职员用公司的邮资机来邮寄自己的圣诞贺卡，他在寄了一张贺卡给公司的财务主管后被发现！我们都读过或听过类似的事情更别说社会各层面存在的种种不诚实行为，如偷窃东西的顾和索取贿赂的政客。去年一年，一家大型连锁酒店的大量毛巾被游客偷走，酒店因此花费了 300 万美元来添置新毛巾。尤其令人担忧的是，世界范围内有关学生不诚实行为的报道越来越多。


5 As I spoke, I realized just how gender-based my communication styles were.??With women, I could be open, emotionally honest, and?transparent.?With male friends, it seemed impossible to express caring feelings no matter how deep the friendship was.??I could easily utter "I love you" to my mother, my sisters and girlfriends; yet not once in my life had I been able to look a male friend in the eye and say the same thing.??Quite impossible!?Was this just me or was every male in the world similarly cursed???Was I emotionally backward or just a "guy"???I was determined to find out!?
说这些时，我意识到我的交流方式是多么地因对方的性别不同而不同。和女性朋友在一起，我可以是开放的、真情流露的、直截了当的。但和男性朋友在一起时，不管我们之间的友情有多深，我似乎都无法表达对对方的关爱之情。对我的母亲、姐妹和女朋友，我可以轻松地说出“我爱你”；然而，我有生以来从未能做到看着一位男性朋友的眼睛并说出同样的话。这完全不可能！这样的情况只是发生在我一个人身上，还是说世界上所有的男人都面对着类似的困扰呢？是我情感不发达还是因为我只是个“男人”？我决心找出真相！
